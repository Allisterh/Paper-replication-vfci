# vfci

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The R package vfci reproduces tables and figures in Adrian, Duarte and Iyer (2023), 
    “The Market Price of Risk and Macro-Financial Dynamics”, 
    [CEPR Press Discussion Paper No. 17777](https://cepr.org/publications/dp17777).

## Installation

You can install the development version of vfci from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("fernando-duarte/vfci")
```

<!-- ## Example -->

<!-- This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem: -->

<!-- ```{r example} -->
<!-- library(vfci) -->
<!-- ## basic example code -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->

<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>. -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN. -->
